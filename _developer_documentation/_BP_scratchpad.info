In progress:
----------------------
Landed Titles:
* Remove Frisian Kingdom (ahistorical-ish) and make a set of duchies
* Review the borders of e_dacia. It would be nice to be able to restore the borders of Roman Dacia, which is not possible with the vanilla setup. In addition, Dacia's de jure borders are probably wrong (for example, this empire includes the lands populated by Iazyges). The existing duchies and kingdoms also should be reworked (i.e d_napoca without Napoca and what even is Dacia Carpetes?).

Culture:
* Implementation of Noric culture for Romano-Noric History ; Namelists here: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/new-cultures.610605/
* Make cultures unavailable before their time, probably via on_action

Decisions:
* Port in old decisions for Heruls, Alamanni, &c. either as a religion feature or culture feature

Mechanics:
* Tribal Hierarchy should have vassalization wars unlocked against tribals (at least for same culture/heritage)
* Tweak rise of minorities of the ruler culture/religion via on_action for pure tribals
* Chance of spawning Legendary Leader each time a char grows in prestige level or firstborn heir is born at a prestige level
	* Should be weighted by total of attribute values

Namelists:
* Update dead dynasty prestiges (Ptolomids &c.)
* Rework Armorican and Vasconic namelists. The current Armorican namelist consists entirely of Breton and French names, while the Vasconic one have too many Visigothic names.

General:
* Slavs need work
* Syagrius COA is off for some reason
* Remove inapplicable rules, like mongol_invasion and hungarian_migration
* Merovingians should change COA to have bees instead of Quinotaur upon conversion to Christianity
* Add missing localizations for Christian doctrine Trigger localizations (first, third, &c.)
* Destroy Verinus house/dynasty banner (or gift to Verinus) after loosing the war?
* Make Skirians under Suavi part of a confederation/tributary of Suavi?
* Make the vassal pagans under Sarir tributaries instead?

----------

* Splitting out of Sami paganism from Finnish??
* Donatism gets option to summon armies

* Tweak conversion values again?? (Too hard??)
* Unification war is borked, leaves a single county untouched.

* Add Game Rule allowing creating more duchy-level tribals for players wanting more "traditional" wtwsms experience
* Fixup Confederaiton name mechanics, as it might be borked.
* Tributary interaction logic is breaking demand tributary interactions in Vanilla.

With art:
* Make Kingdom formation events into splash events
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt

More Consideration:
* Add Ritual Warfare Innovation to tribal, granting +1 MAA regiments??
    - All ranks should have -1 MAA regiments

Add some clouds:

==========================
Religion Branch:
----------------------

* Fixup conversion between rites of the Chalcedonian church
* Make the Gallican church have the same rite as the Hispanic Chuch
* Have Rites have an impact on conversion speed

* Split of Germanic Paganism into Heritage-specific paths?
    * Frankish: Inhumation, Sanctity of Nature, Ritual Celebrations, ??
    * Anglo-Saxon: Inhumation, Ok with magic, Sanctity of Nature, Ritual Celebrations, Human Sacrifice??
    * Gothic: Inhumation, criminal magic, Ancestor Worship, Sanctity of Nature, Human Sacrifice
    * Visclan: Cremation, ??
    * Norse: Cremation, Patron Gods, Blot, Warmonger, ??
    * Cimbrian/Suebic: Cremation??, Sanctity of Nature, Patron Gods??

==========================
0.1.8: Matter of Britain:
* Swampland for Friisia, like the Arabia Felix modifier
Migration Wars:
	* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
	* Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while
* Further cleanup of tribal titles & conversion to confederations
	* Confederations for Alamannia, Thuringia (?!), Germanii, Lemovia, Vidvaria, and the various other small tribal polities
* 2 more bookmarks: July 11, 472 (Gundobad refuses the crown?), December 9, 480 (Odoacer occupies Dalmatia)

In progress:
----------------------
Landed Titles:
* Remove Frisian Kingdom (ahistorical-ish) and make a set of duchies
* Review the borders of e_dacia. It would be nice to be able to restore the borders of Roman Dacia, which is not possible with the vanilla setup. In addition, Dacia's de jure borders are probably wrong (for example, this empire includes the lands populated by Iazyges). The existing duchies and kingdoms also should be reworked (i.e d_napoca without Napoca and what even is Dacia Carpetes?).

History:
* Gepid extents/remove those extranous Huns?

Culture:
* Implementation of Old Persian namelist if it isn't already used.

Mechanics:
* Chance of spawning Legendary Leader each time a char grows in prestige level or firstborn heir is born at a prestige level
	* Should be weighted by total of attribute values

General:
* Destroy Verinus house/dynasty banner (or gift to Verinus) after loosing the war?

----------
* Slavs need work

----------

* Splitting out of Sami paganism from Finnish??

* Tweak conversion values again?? (Too hard??)
* Unification war is borked, leaves a single county untouched.

* Add Game Rule allowing creating more duchy-level tribals for players wanting more "traditional" wtwsms experience
* Fixup Confederaiton name mechanics, as it might be borked.
* Tributary interaction logic is breaking demand tributary interactions in Vanilla.

With art:
* Make Kingdom formation events into splash events
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt

More Consideration:
* Add Ritual Warfare Innovation to tribal, granting +1 MAA regiments??
    - All ranks should have -1 MAA regiments
* Mod the GUI to remove 0-piety sins/virtues?? Doesn't look like it is possible, or is at least horribly janked

Add some clouds:

==========================

==========================
0.1.8: Matter of Britain:
* Swampland for Friisia, like the Arabia Felix modifier
Migration Wars:
	* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
	* Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while
* Further cleanup of tribal titles & conversion to confederations
	* Confederations for Alamannia, Thuringia (?!), Germanii, Lemovia, Vidvaria, and the various other small tribal polities
* 2 more bookmarks: July 11, 472 (Gundobad refuses the crown?), December 9, 480 (Odoacer occupies Dalmatia)

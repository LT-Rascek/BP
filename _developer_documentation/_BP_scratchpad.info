In progress:
----------------------
Landed Titles:
* East vs. West Geats

Subjugation Wars:
* "Pursuit of Power" Tenet should increase Subjugation wars by one
* "Pacifism", "Dharmic Pacifism", "Pastoral Isolation" should decrease Subjugation wars by one
* "Astute Diplomats", "Pacfists", "Fierce Independence" Traditions should decrease Subjugation wars by one
* Add minimum value of 1 to script value

Other (Big):
* circumcellions_army_name and such need to be moved to the proper localization file
* Update version number in main branch event
* Germanic Heritages need to include the North/Central/East/West Kulturbunds (not all do), and all need review
* conqueror culture features for early slavic traditions
* Maronite Cross needs replacement
* WRE capital bug fix as Nepos?

History:
* Gepid extents/remove those extranous Huns?

Culture:
* Implementation of Old Persian namelist if it isn't already used.

Mechanics:
* Chance of spawning Legendary Leader each time a char grows in prestige level or firstborn heir is born at a prestige level
	* Should be weighted by total of attribute values

General:
* Destroy Verinus house/dynasty banner (or gift to Verinus) after loosing the war?
* Tribalizing holding modifier (aka, making nomads tribal) should give conversion/promotion bonus as well

----------
* Slavs need work

----------

* Splitting out of Sami paganism from Finnish??

* Unification war is borked, leaves a single county untouched.

* Add Game Rule allowing creating more duchy-level tribals for players wanting more "traditional" wtwsms experience
* Fixup Confederaiton name mechanics, as it might be borked.
* Tributary interaction logic is breaking demand tributary interactions in Vanilla.

With art:
* Make Kingdom formation events into splash events
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt

More Consideration:
* Add Ritual Warfare Innovation to tribal, granting +1 MAA regiments??
    - All ranks should have -1 MAA regiments
* Mod the GUI to remove 0-piety sins/virtues?? Doesn't look like it is possible, or is at least horribly janked

Add some clouds:

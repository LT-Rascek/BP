In progress:
----------------------
History:
* warnic_history_loc and other suebic_culture locs

Culture:
* Implementation of Old Persian namelist if it isn't already used.

General:
* Tribalizing holding modifier (aka, making nomads tribal) should give conversion/promotion bonus as well

----------
* Slavs need work

----------

* Splitting out of Sami paganism from Finnish??

* Unification war is borked, leaves a single county untouched.

* Add Game Rule allowing creating more duchy-level tribals for players wanting more "traditional" wtwsms experience
* Tributary interaction logic is breaking demand tributary interactions in Vanilla.

With art:
* Make Kingdom formation events into splash events
* Look into making the Fall of Rome Event a "Splash Event" like the 1066 Supernova in VIET_event_chains.txt

More Consideration:
* Add Ritual Warfare Innovation to tribal, granting +1 MAA regiments??
    - All ranks should have -1 MAA regiments
* Mod the GUI to remove 0-piety sins/virtues?? Doesn't look like it is possible, or is at least horribly janked

==========================
Religion Branch:
----------------------

* Split of Germanic Paganism into Heritage-specific paths?
    * Frankish: Inhumation, Sanctity of Nature, Ritual Celebrations, ??
    * Anglo-Saxon: Inhumation, Ok with magic, Sanctity of Nature, Ritual Celebrations, Human Sacrifice??
    * Gothic: Inhumation, criminal magic, Ancestor Worship, Sanctity of Nature, Human Sacrifice
    * Visclan: Cremation, ??
    * Norse: Cremation, Patron Gods, Blot, Warmonger, ??
    * Cimbrian/Suebic: Cremation??, Sanctity of Nature, Patron Gods??

==========================
0.1.8: Matter of Britain:
* Swampland for Friisia, like the Arabia Felix modifier
Migration Wars:
	* Migration overhaul; should become easier, minor migrations should become more common
	* Letting migrants settle should block a realm from further minor migration for a while
* Further cleanup of tribal titles & conversion to confederations
	* Confederations for Alamannia, Thuringia (?!), Germanii, Lemovia, Vidvaria, and the various other small tribal polities
* 2 more bookmarks: July 11, 472 (Gundobad refuses the crown?), December 9, 480 (Odoacer occupies Dalmatia)
